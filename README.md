# numberScaleEarthAge
Project for FC-102-4. Also a place where I try to evaluate my person skills and bring it all together in one small project using web-application development on Python and C++

The sole intent behind making this project was to complete make a cool assignment while doing something I am good at<br>
I am also hoping to get comfortable with a few additional libraries of python<br>
If I do manage to get the C++-Python link working within the time span, that'll be a plus<br>
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript<br>
Back-End: Python3
